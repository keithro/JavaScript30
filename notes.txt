TODO:
* Add webpack for Sass compliling, prefixing, and image loading
* Clean up daily notes.
* ADD: "painstakenly crafted by Keith Rodriguez" ?
* add more info to links on hover? can use scroll height to open info on mobile and tablet
* keep text shadow on name card?

sass watch command:
sass --watch assets/css/styles.scss:assets/css/styles.css


 NOTES
-------
1. HTMLMediaElement.play() to play audio
    Use event listeners to add class to elements and the 'transitionend' event to remove class 
    Use data attriutes
2. Using setInterval, Date and Date.prototype methods to adjust the rotate property.
3. How to change element properties using input selectors.
4. Filter, map, sort, reduce, 
    How to convert HTML node list into an array with either Array.from() or the spread operator.
    Sum up instances using reduce.
    A great example of sorting
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
10. 
11. 
12. Compare array of key presses to secret string
    BONUS: added random color to background
13. Slide in images by calculating how for down user has scrolled and where content is in relation using window.scrollY, window.innerHeight and element.offsetTop.
    Learned what the concept of 'debouncing' is to reduce the rate of event firing and decrese resource consumption.
    * this is also a good example of how to animate by adding a class w/ javascript
14. The difference between referencing and copying variable.
    includes several good methods for copying arrays and objects.
15. How to use local storage for data persistance and event delegation on items after event listeners were created.
    Also points out the benefit of using the 'submit' eventListener over 'click' for forms and the like.
    ADDED: remove all, check all and uncheck all functionality
16. Using offsetTop and offsetLeft to calculate mouse hover position
17. Use a regEx to sort a list of items with articles. Append to DOM using .map .join and .innerHTML
18. Take dataset property and create an array of time in seconds, then calculate total hours, minutes and seconds.
19. create video and image capture using getUserMedia() and HTML5 Canvas and experiment with image effects by adjusting rgba array.
Listen for 'canplay' event before playing video. Needs server - used 'browser-sync' npm package.
20. Event listener for 'results', create new paragraph element, append to div. Needs server - used 'browser-sync' npm package.
21. 
22. Use this.getBoundingClientRect() to get information about where an item is on page and its size.
23. Used SpeechSynthesisUtterance to turn text into speech. The name, pitch, and text input 'name' attributes must be named as such to match up with the utterance. Also learned a couple ways to pass argument into function (from event listener)
24. Fix nav by adding a single class to the body when nav reaches the top of page. Distances calculated with offsetTop, offsetHeight and scrollY.
25. Understanding Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once
    - Capture goes from top of body down to element you clicked on,
    - Bubble will then trigger events back up.
    - You can prevent capture & bubbling by using '.stopPropagation()' on the event (e).
        *this will stop capture from going down and propagation from going up the DOM so if capture set to 'true' the event stops at the outermost parent element.
    - Once will listen for event once and then unbind itself (remove event listener)
26. Again we are using getBoundingClientRect to get positioning info and using add and remove class functions to show/hide the menu
